===> 0.0.2
    - add udp connect back support
    - define a TCP trigger (often you will be blocked by pfs on ICMP)
    - insert boot.conf entry for our fbkit to automatically load after reboot
      and hide this entry in file (lseek() fucking, yeah) - so we don't have
      to use rmdir() hook to remove our fbkit.ko and sux.
    - support freebsd 6.*
